# About me
Hello, I am currently a third-year university student studying Computer Systems and Technologies at Trakya University. I have been focusing on software development for approximately 2 years and have been developing web applications and backend software for the past year. During this time, I have worked on various projects using Java, Python, and JavaScript, with a particular emphasis on Spring Boot and Node.js. Personally, I value teamwork, a friendly environment, and I am someone who approaches problems analytically and enjoys learning.
